# Operator overloading in programming

> In programming, **operator overloading** — less commonly known as operator [ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) — is a specific case of [polymorphism](http://bit.ly/1kr6C8E), where different (operators)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(programming)] have different implementations depending on their arguments. Operator overloading is generally defined by the language, the programmer, or both.

## Motivation

The idea behind opening this repo is to demonstrate operator overloading in different programming languages.

The repo contains a set of folders, each one of those represents specific programming language with two files in it: the source code to proof a concept of operator overloading in the language and the documentation that breaks it down.

## Examples
You may find source code with examples of operator overloading in the specific language under its own folder in the root of the repo. The source code may be successfully compiled and executed using available language tools. If there are any additional actions required to compile the example, these would be mentioned in the documentation.

_**NOTE:** There are few other languages that have a support of operator overloading but not included in the list either due to lack of documentation or unavailability of compiling tools. Some of them: Ada, Delphi, and MATLAB._
